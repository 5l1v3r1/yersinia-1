- provide two different builds of the package. One with the GTK enabled version
  of Yersinia and the other with the CLI only build.

- eventually provide a way to start Yersinia in daemon mode at boot time with a
  default configuration file placed in /etc/yersinia. This configuration file 
  should be customised during install so that we don't have a default Yersinia
  account enabled on all Debian hosts...
  (see yersinia -D -c /etc/yersinia/yersinia.conf -l /var/log/yersinia.log)
